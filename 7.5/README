Gregorian Calendar
------------------

Java API has the GregorianCalendar class in the java.util package that
can be used to obtain the year, month and day of a date. The no-arg
constructor constructs an instance for the current date, and the methods
get(GregorianCalendar.YEAR), get(GregorianCalendar.MONTH), and
get(GregorianCalendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) return the year, month and day.

Write a program to perform two tasks:
* Display the current year, month, and day.
* The GregorianCalendar class has the setTimeInMillis(long), which can
  be used to set a specified elapsed time since January 1, 1970. Set the
  value to 123456789L and display the year, month, and day.
