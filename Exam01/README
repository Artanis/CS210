Game: Rock, Scissors, Paper
---------------------------
Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rocl-paper game. The
program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor,
rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1,
or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer
wins or draws. Note that a scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a
scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock.
