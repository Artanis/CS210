Rectangle Class
---------------

Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class
contains:

* Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width
  and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width
  and height.
* A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
* A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and
  height.
* The accessor and mutator methods for all three data fields.
* A method named getArea() that returns the area of the rectangle.
* A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.

Draw the UML diagram for the class. Implement the class. Write a test
program that creates two Rectangle objects. Assign width 4 and height 40
to the first object and width 3.5 and height 35.9 to the second object.
Assign color red to all Rectangle objects. Display the properties of
both and find their areas and perimeters.
