6.7 - Counting single digits
----------------------------
Write a program that generates 100 random integers between 0 and 9 and
displays the count for each number. (Hint: Use (int)(Math.random() * 10)
to generate a random integer between 0 and 9. Use an array of ten
integers, say 'counts,' to store the counts for the number of 0's,
1's, ..., 9's.)
