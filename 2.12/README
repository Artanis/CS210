Financial Application: Calculating Interest
-------------------------------------------


If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you
can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the
following formula:

    interest = balance * (annual_interest_rate / 1200)

Write a program that reads the balance and annual percentage rate and
displays the interest for the next month in two versions: (a) Use
dialog boxes to obtain input and display output; (b) use console input
and output. A sample run of the console input and output is shown
below:

    Enter Balance: $[100000]
    Enter Annual Interest Rate: %[4.625]
    The interest is $385.41
