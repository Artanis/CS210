Checking ISBN
-------------

An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) consists of 10 digits
("/(\d{9})(\d)/"). The last digit is a checksum, which is calculated
from thhe other nine digits using the following formula:

    d1 + (d2 * 2) + (d3 * 3) + (d4 * 4) + (d5 * 5) +
    (d6 * 6) + (d7 * 7) + (d8 * 8) + (d9 * 9) % 11

If the checksum is 10, the last digit is denoted "X" according to the
ISBN convention. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
first 9 digits and displays the 10 digit ISBN (including leading
zeroes.) Your program should read the input as an integer.
